 Problem 1
    - mpdf/mpdf is locked to version v8.1.4 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - mpdf/mpdf v8.1.4 requires ext-gd * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's gd extension.

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - C:\xampp\php\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-gd` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Go to:
- C:\xampp\php\php.ini and enable the extension=gd, then run this command :  composer update ramsey/uuid
